            <h1 class="margin text-center">Survival Love</h1>
            <h1>CONTEXT</h1>
            <p> The genre of my movie was romance and horror because me and my group mate had to pick a genre but we couldn't decide. I wanted romance as the genre because I liked to watch romance shows. But my partner liked horror because she enjoys the plot of horror movies. We both had different taste in genre but decided to combine both genres together. This allowed us to develop a connection between horror and romance because when we planned the story it was very interesting. We both shared our ideas for images and what the whole movie was going to be about. Both of our thoughts were able to create this movie. </p>
            <h1> CONTENT:</h1>
            <p>My movie is about a boy and girl who never meet each other but were kidnapped and sended to different parts of the woods. Both characters' goals were to escape the woods by working together. They face different challenges throughout the movie. During the time they survive and try to escape,it causes both characters to develop feelings for each other. </p>
            <h1>Challenges:</h1>
            <p> The challenge me and my group mate developed when doing this movie is doing the sequel because there were many problems. The first problem we found was that the css isn't linked to the sequel page. I was struggling to connect it because I forgot how to connect the css and sequels. I had to ask my friends how to connect the sequel and css, which they gave me good steps on how to connect both css and sequel together. The second problem was writing the script because me and my partner had to work at home and she made me do the script but i didn't know what to do for the script and thought how bad it might turn out. I was overthinking and gave myself hate comments because I had a lack of information about horror and romance movies. I was able to get some support from my group mate and continued to write the script. 
            <h1>TakeAway:</h1>
            <p> A TakeAway I learned from this project is to be supportive to your group mates because we were supportive of each other's ideas which resulted in us completing this project. We were both very supportive and allowed each other to add on our ideas. We had a lot of ideas for this movie but went with this theme and genre. Another takeaway I was able to develop during this project was communication because we had to communicate inorder to help each other out. We had a lot of communication which limited our problems because we were able to help each other when needed. Me and my groupmate were able to ask questions and give a good answer to each other's problems which resulted in increasing our knowledge about css and html.
            <h1>Next Step:</h1>
            <p>The next step I would take is to practice what I learned from this project because I want to be able to understand the value of projects and group mates. I know that in SEP we have a lot of group work and harder projects but if i'm able to communicate and be supportive i could be able to get a good grade on the harder projects. I learned that when being supportive and communicating projects or group work are much easier because you have 2 brains inside of 1 which is useful. Another Step i would do is practice HTMl and CSS because I had problems during my project which wasn't hard but I overthink which made me believe it was hard. For html i was forgetting alot of elements i needed for html which made me overthink if i was going to get a good grade, For CSS i was confused on how to add a gradient background but after studying more css i found out it was easy.
