            <h1>CONTEXT</h1>
            <p> The genre of my movie was romance and horror because me and my group mate had to pick a genre but we couldnt decide. I wanted romance as the genre because i liked to watch romance shows. But my partner liked horror because she enjoys the plot of horror movies. We both had different taste in genre but decided to combine both genres together. This allowed us to develop a connection between horror and romance because when we planned the story it was very interesting. We both shared our ideas for images and what the whole movie going to be about. Both of our thinking was able to create this movie. </p>
            <h1> CONTENT:</h1>
            <p>My movie is about a boy and girl who never meet each other but was kidnapped and sended to different parts of the woods. Both character goals was to escape the woods by working together. They face different challeges throughout the movie. During the time they survive and trying to escape. which caused both character to develop feels for each other. </p>
            <h1>Challenges:</h1>
            <p> The challenge me and my group mate devloped when doing this movie is doing the sequel because there was many problems. The first problem we founded was that the css wasnt linked to the sequel page. I was struggling to connect it because i forgot how to connect the css and sequels. I had to ask my friends how to connect the sequel and css, which they gave me good steps on how to connect both css and sequel together. The second problem was writing the script because me and my partner had to work at home and she made me do the script but i didnt know what to do for the script and thought how bad it might turn out. I was overthinking and gave myself hate comment because i had lack of information about horror and romance movies. I was able to get some support from my group mate and continued to write the script. 
            <h1>TakeAway:</h1>
            <p> A TakeAway i learned from this project is to be supportive to your group mates because we were supportive in each others idea which resulted in us completing this roject. We were both very supportive and allowed each other to add on our ideas. We had alot of ideas for this movie but went with this theme and genre. Another takeaway i was able to develop during this project was communication because we had to communicate inorder to help each other out. We had alot of communication which limited our problems because we were able to help each other when needed. Me and my groupmate was able to ask questions and give a good answwer to each others problem which resulted in increasing our knowledge about css and html.
