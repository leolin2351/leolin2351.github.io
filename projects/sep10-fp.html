            <h1>CONTEXT</h1>
            <p>The prompt of this portofio was to create a webiste about my choosen topic. We had to use bookstrap component and what we learned throughtout the school year. This was to show the progress we achieved throughout SEP10. I made a educational website about business by showing the hardwares and softwares that business majors use to achieve their goals of being successful. I used many different types of bokstrap components like nava bar, carosuel, cards, and many more. These were some bookstrap compnents i use to make my website look outstanding and unique.</p>
            <h1>ChallengesT</h1>
            <p>I faced many challenges when creating my website. many of the challenges got me furious and dragged me down which didnt turn out how i wanted to be. One major challenge i faced was using my imagination. This was a challenge because i had imagined what i wanted my work to be and shared my ideas with some of my friends and my friends thought it was cool so they wanted to use my ideas. But when my friends used my ideas i had to change it so it was a duplicate of my friends work. This is where my challenge came in to play because i could only think of what my first idea was and nothing else which made me ask someone for their idea. which got me in trouble because i copied someone elses idea.</p> 
            <h1>Takeaway:</h1>
            <p<A takeaway i learned was dont share great ideas with your friends because it can back fire. I shared my ideas with my friends which caused me to over think and unable to restore the liking of my imagination. I learned this the hard way because i saw many of my friends got good scores because they took inspration on my ideas which caused me to understand that i should be prood on my ideas rather than sharing it which can cause backfire on me. </p>
                <h1>Next step</h1>
               <p> My next step is to study and be ready for next year. This year was a mess for me i had many issues with friends and family which caused me to unable to become what i wanted to be which was to be smart. I had alot of problems dragging me down like work quality but this year is when i learn and next year is when i show my strength not my weakness.</p>
