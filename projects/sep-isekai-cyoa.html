            <h1 class="margin text-center">Isekai into another fantasy world</h1>
            <h1>CONTEXT</h1>
            <p> The genre of our movie is being isekai into another fantasy world. Me and my group members chose isekai to another fantasy world because we enjoyed anime and liked to see how a weak human gets stronger and defeats challenging monsters. Isekai is when you die and get resurrected to start a new life. Me and my group members had to figure out what kind of isekai we were doing. We needed to find a suitable introduction of our project but we both had different ways to start it. This granted our ability to think more deeply and how to connect both of the topics together. We thought of getting hit by a truck like normal isekai but we wanted to be more different so we decided to save a girl from a group of stalkers. We had to plan out what happens to each route you choose. This made us be creative and find out the plot of the story. </p>
            <h1> CONTENT:</h1>
            <p>This project is about you walking to the grocery store. You brought many different ingredients to prepare for dinner but you saw a girl getting stalked. Which led you to make a choice between saving the girl from a gang or not getting involved from the scene. Every choice leads you to a different opinion and restart your adventure in a new world. During your life in the new world you have to face challenges and get stronger. This led you to think of your choices and have a great adventure and make the resurrection worth it. </p>
            <h1>Challenges:</h1>
            <p> A challenge I had was communication because one of my partners was inactive with this project which had to make me help them out. She wasn't active on this project and always said she didn't understand which made her give an excuse that she didn't know or she had connection problems. This got me and my other partner mad but we kept it cool so we tried our best to teach them but she didn't want to listen. So me and my other partner did her part of her work and had to figure out the new part of the opinions. Me and my other partner had to plan out who does what part of the project so we planned out on me completing her part of her planning and he would do the cs50 part. We had good communication with each other but not with our other partner because she didn't want to do work and wanted the grade we got. </p>
            <h1>TakeAway:</h1>
            <p> I learned to stay patient throughout this project. Me and my other partner had many things we were mad about because one of our partners didn't want to do her work. We tried our best to teach her what she was missing but she didn't want to care about it. We asked her for her notes but it was empty. Me and my other partner needed to do something about it so we don't lose our grade. I stayed very patient and asked if she would complete her part but she was very distracted. I didn't want her carelessness of this class to ruin my grade so me and my other partner needed to double our work. This was a hard thing to do because we needed to fill in her part of the work. This takeaway is something I learned because I stayed very patient so she could try to help us but in the end she didn't but my other partner was willing to step up so we were able to complete the project.</p>
            <h1>Next Step:</h1>
            <p>The next step I need to practice on the html part of this project. I didn't understand it at first but with the help of my friends from different periods I was able to try to complete it. I needed to know the guideline of the recruitment of the standard of what the teacher wanted. I needed to use my html knowledge to complete this project. I also needed to use my notes to help me understand html to carry me through this project. I had some struggling moments but had some good moments from this project. This shows that for my next step I need to keep improving and feel comfortable for future projects.</p>
