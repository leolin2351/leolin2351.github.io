            <h1 class="margin text-center">Survival Love</h1>
            <h1>CONTEXT</h1>
            <p> The genre of our movie is being isekai into another fantasy world. Me and my group members chose isekai to another fantasy world because we enjoyed anime and liked to see how a weak human gets stronger and defeats challenging monsters. Isekai is when you die and get resurrected to start a new life. Me and my group members had to figure out what kind of isekai we were doing. We needed to find a suitable introduction of our project but we both had different ways to start it. This granted our ability to think more deeply and how to connect both of the topics together. We thought of getting hit by a truck like normal isekai but we wanted to be more different so we decided to save a girl from a group of stalkers. We had to plan out what happens to each route you choose. This made us be creative and find out the plot of the story. </p>
            <h1> CONTENT:</h1>
            <p>This project is about you walking to the grocery store. You brought many different ingredients to prepare for dinner but you saw a girl getting stalked. Which led you to make a choice between saving the girl from a gang or not getting involved from the scene. Every choice leads you to a different opinion and restart your adventure in a new world. During your life in the new world you have to face challenges and get stronger.  </p>
            <h1>Challenges:</h1>
            <p> A challenge I had was communication because one of my partners was inactive with this project which had to make me help them out. She wasn't active on this project and always said she didn't understand which made her give an excuse that she didn't know or she had connection problems. This got me and my other partner mad but we kept it cool so we tried our best to teach them but she didn't want to listen. So me and my other partner did her part of her work and had to figure out the new part of the opinions. Me and my other partner had to plan out who does what part of the project so we planned out on me completing her part of her planning and he would do the cs50 part. We had good communication with each other but not with our other partner because she didn't want to do work and wanted the grade we got. </p>
            <h1>TakeAway:</h1>
            <p> A TakeAway I learned from this project is to be supportive to your group mates because we were supportive of each other's ideas which resulted in us completing this project. We were both very supportive and allowed each other to add on our ideas. We had a lot of ideas for this movie but went with this theme and genre. Another takeaway I was able to develop during this project was communication because we had to communicate inorder to help each other out. We had a lot of communication which limited our problems because we were able to help each other when needed. Me and my groupmate were able to ask questions and give a good answer to each other's problems which resulted in increasing our knowledge about css and html.</p>
            <h1>Next Step:</h1>
            <p>The next step I would take is to practice what I learned from this project because I want to be able to understand the value of projects and group mates. I know that in SEP we have a lot of group work and harder projects but if i'm able to communicate and be supportive i could be able to get a good grade on the harder projects. I learned that when being supportive and communicating projects or group work are much easier because you have 2 brains inside of 1 which is useful. Another Step i would do is practice HTMl and CSS because I had problems during my project which wasn't hard but I overthink which made me believe it was hard. For html i was forgetting alot of elements i needed for html which made me overthink if i was going to get a good grade, For CSS i was confused on how to add a gradient background but after studying more css i found out it was easy.</p>
